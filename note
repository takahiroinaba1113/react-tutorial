Files and Folders 

package.json
-> contains dependencies and scripts requeried for this project

package-lock.json
-> consistency installation of dependencies 

node_modules
-> where all the dependencies are installed

public 
1. manifest.json
2. favicon.ico
3. index.html
-> only hmtl file for the single page application
-> this is the one that shows up when the app starts

scr
1. index.js
-> ReactDOM.render to render 
2. App.js
-> responsible for HTML to display -> JSX
3. App.css

React 
Components
1. header
2. sidenav
3. main content
4. footer
5. root that nests all other Components
-> basically in .js Files

Component Types
- Stateless funtional Components
-> JavaScript functions that return JSX
- stateful class Component
-> class extends component class that has render() to return JSX

Components summary
- components describe a part of the user interface
- reusable and can be nested inside other components 
- two types: stateless functional components & stategul class components

Functional Components 
- JavaScript function
- receives properties(props) that are attributes of HTML
- return JSX (to generate HTML)

Class components
- ES6 class to return JSX (HTML)
- it can maintain state (information that is private to the class)

Functional vs Class components
Functional
- simple functions
- use function approach to create components if possible
- absence of 'this' keyword
- solution without using state
- mainly responsible for the UI
- stateless/dumb/presentational
-> now it can be stateful!!

Class
- more feature rich
- maintain their own private data - state
- complex UI logic
- provide lifecycle hooks
- stategful/state/container

hooks
- a new feature proposal that lets you use state and other React features in function

JSX
- JavaScript XML (JSX) is extension to JavaScript language syntax
- write XML-like code for elements and components
- JSX tags have a tag name, attributes, and children
- JSX transpiles to pure JavaScript which is understood by browser
- JSX differences compared to HTML

props
- immutable
